                        As the Project Manager, I was responsible for overseeing the entire project, from planning and coordination

                        This project took place at the Information Agency of the Office for Youth and Vocational Guidance in Zurich and 
                        lasted one month. I worked at 60% capacity, with the project being carried out alongside my regular daily

                    <p>The project was structured in three phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Document the API of Studienwahl</li>
                        <li>Make the event subpage of Studienwahl more user-friendly</li>

                    <p>
                        For this project, the Information Agency requested a detailed documentation of the 
                        website’s API. This was necessary to understand how the import process between databases functions. 
                        The resulting documentation provides a solid guide for similar future projects, enabling more efficient 
                        implementation without having to start from scratch. Due to the confidential nature of some governmental data, 
                        I will not elaborate on the first phase and will proceed directly to the second.

                 <!-- The Problem -->
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        A known problem at the agency was that the events page on Studienwahl was overflowing with listings, 
                        making it hard for students to find what they were searching for.
                        Institutions like ETH and UZH, which only host information events twice a year, were 
                        buried under a flood of listings from schools like Kalaidos or ZHAW that hold sessions almost every week. 
                        This was a problem because, statistically, most users are primarily interested in the larger institutions.</p>

                 <!-- Designing a Process -->
                    <h3>Designing a Process</h3>
                    <p>I started by mapping out a structured process to bring order to the chaos. This involved
                        several key steps: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a clear framework to decide which events should actually appear on the site</li>
                        <li>Grouping recurring events into concise quarterly overviews, so the page wouldn’t get clogged with 
                            dozens of similar posts by merging them into single entries that linked to multiple study programs, 
                            making them easier to find and understand</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../img/studienwahl/process-events.png" alt="Designed Process" class="pb-3 content-img">
                    <p>To keep everything consistent, I drafted a UX writing template that set the tone and ensured each event 
                        would give students the same kind of quick, useful snapshot.</p>

                    <h3>Implementation & Results</h3>
                    <p>Once the process was in place, I trained the team so they could maintain this clarity moving forward. 
                        I also thought carefully about how these events should appear on the site. Instead of long lists, 
                        I opted for a card-based UI, making it easier to scan and compare options.</p>

                    <p>The impact was immediate: the events page became much more manageable, and students could find 
                        the key information they were looking for without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

                    <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
                    <p>To identify additional friction points, I organized usability tests with representative users. They 
                        navigated the platform while thinking aloud. This revealed critical insights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The homepage filter produced too many broad results, often surfacing unrelated programs</li>
                        <li>Key features like hiding options were locked behind account creation</li>
                        <li>The idea generator tool produced vague results, failing to guide students effectively</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to time restrictions, I decided to address the filtering system on the homepage, since it was 
                        the most pressing issue. The other two points were documented for future improvements.</p>

                    <h3>Improving the Filtering System</h3>
                    <p>I first needed to understand the root cause. I discovered that all study programs were tagged with the 
                        highest relevance level (3) for multiple subjects and interests, even if they were not the most relevant.</p>

                    <p>To address this problem, I collaborated with study advisors to review and adjust relevance levels 
                        for hundreds of programs. Finally, I built a detailed matrix to drive this reclassification, and 
                        once approved, I implemented it in the backend. This reduced irrelevant search hits, making the 
                        portal significantly more intuitive.</p>

                 <!-- Reflection -->
                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>Through this process, I learned how critical it is to balance reducing information overload while 
                        preserving essential data. Students can now filter more precisely, navigating Studienwahl with less 
                        frustration and greater confidence.</p>
                    <p>This project highlighted the power of small, data-informed UX adjustments to drive substantial improvements 
                        in user satisfaction.</p>
