                        Studienwahl (study choice portal) is an online platform that helps prospective 
                        students explore and choose the right study program in Zurich or the neighboring 
                        cantons.

                        Improve the user experience of Studienwahl to enhance end-user satisfaction 
                        through better usability, structured event management, and refined filtering.

                        Vocational Guidance in Zurich and lasted one month. I worked at 60% capacity, 
                        with the project being carried out alongside my regular daily tasks.

                <p>
                    For this project, the Information Agency requested a detailed documentation of the 
                    website’s API. This was necessary to understand how the import process between 
                    databases functions. The resulting documentation provides a solid guide for similar 
                    future projects, enabling more efficient implementation without having to start 
                    from scratch. Due to the confidential nature of some governmental data, I will not 
                    elaborate on the first phase and will proceed directly to the second.

             <!-- The Problem -->   
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    A known problem at the agency was that the events page on Studienwahl was overflowing 
                    with listings, making it hard for students to find what they were searching for. 
                    Institutions like ETH and UZH, which only host information events twice a year, 
                    were buried under a flood of listings from schools like Kalaidos or ZHAW that hold 
                    sessions almost every week. This was a problem because, statistically, most users 
                    are primarily interested in the larger institutions.
                </p>
             <!-- Designing a Process -->
                <h3>Designing a Process</h3> 
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I started by mapping out a structured process to bring order to the chaos. This 
                        involved several key steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating a clear framework to decide which events should actually appear on 
                                the site</li>
                            <li>Grouping recurring events into concise quarterly overviews, so the page wouldn’t 
                                get clogged with dozens of similar posts by merging them into single entries that 
                                linked to multiple study programs, making them easier to find and understand</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <img src="../assets/img/studienwahl/Event Process.png"
                class="w-100 modal-trigger"
                alt="Detailed process explaining how to create a new event">
                <p>
                    To keep everything consistent, I drafted a UX writing template that set the tone and 
                    ensured each event would give students the same kind of quick, useful snapshot.
                </p>
             <!-- Implementation & Results -->
                <h3>Implementation & Results</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the process was in place, I trained the team so they could maintain this clarity 
                    moving forward. I also thought carefully about how these events should appear on the site. 
                    Instead of long lists, I opted for a card-based UI, making it easier to scan and compare 
                    options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact was immediate: the events page became much more manageable, and students could 
                    find the key information they were looking for without feeling overwhelmed.
                </p>

                <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        To identify additional friction points, I organized usability tests with representative 
                        users. They navigated the platform while thinking aloud. This revealed critical insights:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The homepage filter produced too many broad results, often surfacing unrelated programs</li>
                            <li>Key features like hiding options were locked behind account creation</li>
                            <li>The idea generator tool produced vague results, failing to guide students effectively</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Due to time restrictions, I decided to address the filtering system on the homepage, 
                    since it was the most pressing issue. The other two points were documented for future 
                    improvements.
                </p>
             <!-- Improving the Filtering System -->
                <h3>Improving the Filtering System</h3> 
                <p>
                    I first needed to understand the root cause. I discovered that all study programs were 
                    tagged with the highest relevance level (3) for multiple subjects and interests, even 
                    if they were not the most relevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address this problem, I collaborated with study advisors to review and adjust relevance 
                    levels for hundreds of programs. Finally, I built a detailed matrix to drive this 
                    reclassification, and once approved, I implemented it in the backend. This reduced 
                    irrelevant search hits, making the portal significantly more intuitive.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Through this process, I learned how critical it is to balance reducing information overload 
                    while preserving essential data. Students can now filter more precisely, navigating Studienwahl 
                    with less frustration and greater confidence.

                    This project highlighted the power of small, data-informed UX adjustments to drive substantial 
                    improvements in user satisfaction.
